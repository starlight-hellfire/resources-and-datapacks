<h1>Lemily's Minecraft Packs</h1>
<p>This is a collection of resourcepacks and datapacks that I have created for minecraft, spanning various versions of the game. From making ore blocks more visible to changing crafting recipes, I've put together a selection of changes to the game that make it feel nice to play</p>
<h2>General structure:</h2>
<p>Top level folders separate <strong>resourcepacks</strong> from <strong>datapacks</strong>. Inside are subfolders named after each pack, for example High_Visibility_Ores.
Within the pack folder lay subfolders of the pack for each Minecraft version(s) it is compatible with. Feel free to peruse the files inside to get a general idea of the pack</p>

<h2>Installation:</h2>
<p><strong>Simple download (recommended):</strong> Navigate to the Releases page and select the release for the pack you wish to use. Download the zip file for your desired game version. Then install the zip in the appropriate directory in your <code>~/.minecraft/</code> folder (vanilla launcher), or follow the instructions for your launcher.</p>
<p><strong>Alternate method:</strong> download the whole repo, unzip it, and copy the folder for your desired version into the appropriate directory. Or download it from the command line</p>

<h2>Version Compatability:</h2>
<p>If you can't find a download for your desired Minecraft version, you can create it yourself:</p>
<li> To begin, follow the above instructions to download the higher version closest to your desired version. Do not install the folder in the game's folders yet. Unzip the pack (if necessary).</li> <li>Open the file "pack.mcmeta" in your text editor. Edit the "pack_format" field to the proper value as according to https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format for your desired version, then save the file.</li> <li>Finally, copy the encompassing folder (the folder created when unzipped) and paste it in the appropriate directory</li>
<p>Additionally, I highly recommend editing the folder name and the "description" field in pack.mcmeta to reflect the appropriate Minecraft version</p>
