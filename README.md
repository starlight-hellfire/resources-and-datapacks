This is a collection of resourcepacks and datapacks that I have created for minecraft, spanning various versions of the game.
In the directories are subdirectories with a name that describes the pack, such as High_Visibility_Ores.
Within the pack directory is more subdirectories that are named according to the minecraft version(s) it is compatible with.

Just select the folder titled with the game version you want and download it, then put it in your resource pack folder (resource packs) or world's datapack folder (datapacks).
If you can't find a version, download the closest one to your version and edit the "pack_format" field in the pack.mcmeta file according to https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format for your desired version
