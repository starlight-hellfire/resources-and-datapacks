<h1>Lemily's Minecraft Packs</h1>
<p>This is a collection of resourcepacks and datapacks that I have created for minecraft, spanning various versions of the game. From making ore blocks more visible to changing crafting recipes, I've put it these changes to the game that make it feel nice here</p>
<h2>General structure:</h2>
<p>Top level folders separate resourcepacks from datapacks. Inside are subfolders named after each pack, for example High_Visibility_Ores.
Within the pack folder lay subfolders of the pack for each minecraft version(s) it is compatible with. Feel free to peruse the files inside to get a general idea of the pack</p>

<h2>Installation:</h2>
<p>For a simple download, navigate to the Releases page and download the zip file for your desired game version. Then install the zip in the appropriate directory in your ~/.minecraft/ folder (vanilla launcher), or follow the instructions for your launcher.</p>
<p>Alternatively, download the whole repo's zip, unzip it, and copy the folder for your desired version into the appropriate directory</p>

<h2>Version Compatability:</h2>
<p>If you can't find a dowload for your desired minecraft version, first, follow the above instuctions to download the version closest to your desired version. Do not install the folder in the game's folders yet. Unzip the pack (if necessary). Open the file "pack.mcmeta" in your text editor. Edit the "pack_format" field to the proper value as according to https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format for your desired version, then save the file. Proceed with the installation instructions as directed above.</p>
<p>Additionally, I highly reccomend editing the folder name, and the "description" field whilst you edit pack.mcmeta, to reflect the appropriate minecraft version</p>
